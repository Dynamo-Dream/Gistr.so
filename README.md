Image of the Gistr appHere's one tip that no one talks about: always share what you study. Why? Because when I share my notes, the gratitude and support I get motivates me to do it again and do it better. It's a cycle that helps me learn more, create better notes, and reinforce my understanding by teaching others.
Now, let me show you my 5-step strategy to take notes effectively using a platform I absolutely love Gistr.

Step 1: Start with the Right Video
Pick a video you want to learn from.
On Gistr we usually create a thread - a combo of video, clips, and notes. It's like bookmarking the best parts of the video and having your notes right there for easy reference. It saves me from endless rewatching or hunting for that one concept I forgot from a video.
Adding A new video to create notesStep 2: Highlight While Watching
Highlighting I feel really helps to keep the key parts to us. Previously for video we had nothing like this, but now it is possible and i feel this is where the magic begins. While watching, I highlight anything that feels important. These initial highlights might not be perfect, but that's okay. They give me a quick overview of the video's main ideas.
By the time the video ends, I already know which parts I need to refine or focus on. This step saves me hours of rewatching!
Creating easy highlightsStep 3: Ask Questions About Your Highlights to AI
Here's a trick I learned the hard way: always ask questions.
Before AI it was really difficult to ask questions because you had to go to different sources, which distracts me from the video and also take a lot a time, but now it is becoming easier.
Even if I think I've fully understood something, I pause and ask:
Why is this important?

Sometime you might not fully grasp the concepts told in video than again AI really helps me. I add these things in my personal Notes which saves time and helps in future.
This habit helps me solidify my understanding and ensures my notes are useful for future reference.
Step 4: Add Your Thoughts
This is my favorite step! While AI really help in notemaking process, I always like to sprinkle in my own thoughts.
Sometimes I add an example, other times I clarify a point or link it to something I've learned before. Writing my thoughts makes the notes feel truly mine and helps me see the bigger picture.
Step 5: Review and Refine
Once I've finished the video, I take a few minutes to:
Remove highlights that don't feel necessary anymore.
Read through my notes and fill in any gaps.
Reflect on what I've learned and make sure it's clear.

By now, I've reviewed the content three times, which makes it stick in my memory.
Bonus I Shared before.
This step isn't optional for me. Sharing what I've learned whether with friends, study groups, or online communities not only helps others but also reinforces my learning. Plus, it's fun to see others benefit from something I've worked on!
Why I Love Gistr
Note-taking from video can feel overwhelming and other platforms i feel has to many options which does not help but rather discourage you. But Gistr makes it simple.
It helps me focus on what matters.
I can revisit key moments without wasting time.
Sharing my notes is effortless.

I hope I might have been able to share something valuable to all of
